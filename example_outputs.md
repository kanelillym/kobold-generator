Imagine a dark green kobold with a brown belly and piercing emerald eyes. Xar nubby tail is wiggling as dance exuberantly.

Imagine a rust-red kobold with black spots and black eyes. It's fidgeting with its long tail.

Imagine a cerulean kobold with teal speckles and sleepy red eyes. They're trying to bite your leg, but their mouth is too small.
